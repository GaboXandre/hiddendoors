# HiddenDoors

Imagine hiding a secret room. The door is invisible unless you know where to look...
HiddenDoors uses default textures to create walkable (and climbable) trapdoors.

Included:
* Dirt
* Wood
* Tree
* Brick
* Stone
* Stone Brick
* Desert Stone
* Desert Stone Brick
* Obsidian

In the inventory, the texture is surrounded by a yellow frame to distinguish from the real nodes. But once placed they look identical.

## Dependencies

## Credits
Textures are taken from default mod. Credits can be found in the readme.txt included with default mod.
